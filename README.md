| Folder | What it is | claude.ai artifact |

## Notes

- Each page is a single self-contained HTML file: Tailwind CDN 3.4.17 for the exported Figma markup, Google Fonts (Inter, Instrument Serif), no build step.
- Animations play when a section enters the viewport and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Some chart values in the bentos are sample data (humidity curve, range datasets, comparison bars, valve log); see each artifact's notes.
- The bento rules live in the `fetchly-bento` Claude Code skill, which builds on the stageshow skill.
